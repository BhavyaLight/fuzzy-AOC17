# fuzzy-AOC17
## Story
I am trying out http://adventofcode.com/  for fun. Making a github repository is only to keep me motivated for pushing code everyday and not slacking off. 
This is my end of 2017 goal - learn new languages by solving the AOC17 problems :) So I will try to present a solution in more than one language to the best of my abilities (inspiration from my flatmate).
Java and Python are my two pet languages.
